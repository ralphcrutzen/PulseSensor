# PulseSensor

Use an Arduino, a [PulseSensor](https://pulsesensor.com/), a speaker and a led as a heart rate monitor. The speaker beeps when the BMP > 80.

Info about installing the PulseSensor library is [here](https://pulsesensor.com/pages/installing-our-playground-for-pulsesensor-arduino).

Note: there are sound issues when using an Arduino Pro Micro. See https://github.com/WorldFamousElectronics/PulseSensorPlayground/issues/126
